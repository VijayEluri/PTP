<p>Synchronized projects consist of files that are mirrored on the local system as well as on one or more remote systems.
Editing occurs locally and each file is synchronized with the currently active remote system when it is changed, created, or deleted.  
This enables faster interaction with the files
and editor, more CDT editor features since the files are local, and continued interaction for editing etc. if the network
connection is lost.
<p>
<h2 id=prereq>Requirements for Synchronized Projects</h2>
<p>To host a synchronized project, the remote system must support the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> distributed version control system.

<h2 id=create>Creating a new Synchronized Project</h2>
<p>To create a new Synchronized Project, use the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Select <b>File > New > Other...</b>
and in the wizard selection dialog, then select <b>Remote > Synchronized Project</b>.
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-newproj.png">
<p><br></p>
<p>Or, from the context menu (right-mouse) in the Project Explorer,
select <b>New > Synchronized Project</b>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojContext.png">
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
Enter a name for the project
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>Choose <b>Makefile Project > Empty Project</b> for the <b>Project type</b>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojCreate.png">
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <b>Next > </b> and then <b>Next > </b> again.</p>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
On the "Configure Remote Synchronization" page, you should see the Git Synchronization Provider is already selected (different providers
may be available in the future). Select an existing connection or create a new one. 
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojNewConnection.png">
<p><br></p>
<li>
Select the <b>New...</b> button to create a new remote connection with the <b>Remote Tools</b> remote service provider.
The Target Environment Configuration dialog is shown. Fill in host name, user, and password (or other authentication
information).
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojConnection.png">
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
Select <b>Finish</b>.  The connection will be tested at this
point before returning to the <b>Configure Remote Synchronization</b> page.
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
Specify a remote location by selecting <b>Browse...</b>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojConfigLocn.png">
<p><br></p>
<li>
A <b>Browse Directory</b> dialog appears in which you can navigate to find the directory
in which your new project's files will be contained on the remote system. Hit <b>OK</b> to finish.
The <b>Configure Remote Synchronization</b> page now contains the location of the remote files:
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojLocn.png">
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>
Hit <b>Finish</b> to complete project creation. If the remote location does not exist, it is
created. Otherwise, the files in that directory will be synchronized to the local workspace.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="work">Working with a Synchronized Project</h2>
<p>Edit the files as you would any local project.
Each time you save a file, it will be synchronized with the remote system. If you create or delete files, the remote system will be updated appropriately.
</p>
<p>
By default, a synchronized project is configured to build on the same remote host used for synchronization. To build the project (assuming you have already 
created a makefile), make sure the project is selected in the <b>Project Explorer</b> view, then click on the build icon (the icon that looks like a hammer).
A build configuration called "Workspace" is also available to build on the local machine if this is required.
</p>
<p>
You can create configurations to synchronize and build on other remote systems using the <b>C/C++ Build > Synchronize</b> project properties.
To bring up the Synchronize project properties, in the <b>Project Explorer</b> view, select the project and choose <b>Properties</b> from the context
menu (right click).
</p>
<p><img src="images/sync-projProperties.png">
<p>
Synchronization is done between the local workspace and the active configuration. You can change the active configuration by using the 
<b>Build Configurations > Set Active...</b> context menu on the project or via the <b>Manage Configurations</b> button on the <b>Synchronize</b>
properties page. If "Workspace" is the active configuration, no synchronization is done.
</p>

<h2 id="context-menu">Changing sync behavior with the Sync Context Menu</h2>
<p>The sync context menu lets you alter the sync behavior and can be accessed with a right click on a sync project.</p>

<h3 id="context-menu-sync">Changing sync frequency and manually sync'ing</h3>
<p>
The sync context menu lets you alter the sync behavior and can be accessed with a right click on a sync project. From this menu, you can turn off automatic sync'ing (sync after saving files and other resource changes) so that syncs only occur on request. This setting is applied to all projects in the workspace. The "Project Auto-Sync Settings" submenu allows you to alter the behavior of automatic sync'ing per project. Finally, the last two selections allow you to force an immediate sync of the current project. A "sync all" syncs all configurations of a project. Note that this can be quite slow if your project has several configurations. When a build is requested, a sync of the active configuration, and only the active configuration, is forced regardless of any settings.

<p><img src="images/sync-contextMenu.png">

<h3 id="context-menu-file-list">Excluding and Including Files from Synchronization</h3>
<p>
Also accessible from the context menu, the "Sync File Exclude/Include List" allows you to change what files are synchronized, either for the current project or for all new projects created in the workspace, depending on the option selected. (For files and folders, "Exclude Selection" and "Include Selection" shortcut options are also available.) By default, binary files and files and directories used by Eclipse are excluded. The "File View" always indicates the currently excluded and included directories and files, while the "Pattern View" always shows the current exclude and include patterns. Each view updates automatically if the other view is changed, so that they are always in agreement. By default, remote files are not shown. Showing remote files may lead to a slower response time while updating views. An error message is printed if the remote is disconnected.

<p>
You can deselect or select directories or files in the File View, which will add the corresponding exclude or include pattern to the pattern view. These are "path" patterns, meaning that directories or files in the specified path are excluded or included. In the pattern view, you can enter a regular expression pattern ("regex") that is compared to the project-relative path. The regular expression syntax is that of the Java programming language. Select either "exclude" or "include" to add the pattern. An error message is printed if the regular expression is not valid. You can select "special" patterns from the "Select pattern" drop-down, although currently the only special pattern is one for matching binary files.

<p>
Patterns are applied in the order given in the Pattern View, and new patterns are always placed at the top (highest priority). So a file will be excluded or included based on the first matching pattern, or included if no pattern matches. Use the "Up" and "Down" buttons to change a pattern's priority. If a new pattern is identical to an old pattern and has the same type, the old pattern is deleted. Note that it doesn't matter whether the old pattern was an exclude or include pattern, since the new pattern supersedes it.

<h2 id="conversion-wizard">Converting a project to a Synchronized Project</h2>
<p>
The conversion wizard allows you to convert current C/C++ or Fortran projects to synchronized projects. Currently only local projects can be converted. To convert a project right-click in the workspace and select <b>New > Other...</b> In the wizard selection dialog, select <b> Remote > Convert C/C++ or Fortran Project to a Synchronized Project > Next</b>. From this dialog, you can select a project to convert and configure a remote site. See <a href="#create">Creating a new Synchronized Project</a> for details on configuring a remote site. This wizard will add a single new remote build configuration. Its settings are copied from the current active configuration. You can change these settings and add new configurations as with any other synchronization project. See <a href="#work">Working with a Synchronized Project</a> for details.

<h2 id="includes">Remote Include Paths</h2>
<p>At the time of the PTP 5.0 release (June 2011),
 the  mechanism for supporting remote includes in CDT  
 does not work automatically with synchronized projects yet, as it 
 requires some integration with the remote scanner discovery (which discovers what includes/defines 
 are set on the remote system). 

<p>You can currently manually configure remote include files as follows:
<ol>
<li>Open the project properties
<p><br></p></li>
<li>Open the <b>C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols</b> page
<p><br></p></li>
<li>Choose the build configuration you want to use
<p><br></p></li>
<li>Click on <b>GNU C</b> and remove the existing paths
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>Add new paths to the remote include directories using 
 UNC notation <code>//connection_name/usr/include</code> where 'connnection_name' is the name of the connection you specified 
 for the Remote Tools service provider
 <p><br></p>
 For example, to add the include path <code>/usr/include</code> using the connection <code>lincoln.ncsa.uiuc.edu</code> that you
 previously configured, you would use the path <code>//lincoln.ncsa.uiuc.edu/usr/include</code>
 <p><br></p>
</li>
<li>Click OK then OK again. You may be asked if you want to rebuild the index. Click Yes.
</li>
</ol>
