<h1 id="top"> Running the OpenACC Tools within the Parallel Language Development Tools</h1>

<p>The Parallel Language Development Tools work on C, C++, and Fortran projects.

<ol>
<li>Within the project, create a source file that includes OpenACC code.
<li>In the Project Explorer View, select the source file to analyze, to find the OpenACC artifacts.
To do this, click on the source file in the Project Explorer on the left to highlight it.
<p>Click the "Show MPI Artifacts" menu item in the PLDT icon menu  in the tool bar.
<br> <img src="images/accMenu.png">
<br>(Note: if it complains that a source file is not selected the first time, select it again and retry.)
<p>The workbench with the selection and menu item is shown below:

<p><script> thumb("images/accButtons.gif",300)</script>
<li>The MPI Artifact View is opened, if it was not present.
It is populated with OpenACC artifacts found.

<p>&nbsp;
<li>Double click on any line in the OpenACC Artifact View
to navigate the editor to that line in the source file.
<li>Rows in the OpenACC Artifact View can be sorted by any of the columns.
Click on the column heading to sort.
<li>Click the "Clear OpenACC Artifacts Markers" button (red X)
in the tool bar <i>of the OpenACC Artifact View</i> to remove all
the MPI artifacts.

<li>You can run the analysis on another file and its markers
will be added to the view.
<li>You can run the analysis on more than one file (multiple selection)
or a container (folder or project), to analyze more than one file at a time.
Click on a project or a folder, then select the
"Show OpenACC Artifacts" action
 to run it on all C source files in that folder.

<p>
<li><b>Content Assist</b><br>
Type an incomplete OpenACC function name e.g. "acc_get_"
and hit Ctrl-Space. The information that is shown
is populated with CDT completions including argument
types, but in addition, the PTP-OpenACC tools also provide
specific information about actual OpenACC functions
where appropriate, and a yellow popup with additional 
textual descriptive information about the function.
Pick the one you want with the arrow keys or the mouse, to add the API to your source file.

a function name, a help view appears which shows additional information.
