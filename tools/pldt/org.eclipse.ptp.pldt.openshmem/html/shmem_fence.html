<h4>Purpose</h4>


<p>Assures ordered delivery of puts.
</p>

<h4>C syntax</h4>

<pre>
#include &lt;shmem.h&gt;
 
void shmem_fence(void);
 
</pre>

<h4>Description</h4>

<div class="ledi">
<p>This function ensures ordering of remote write operations</p>
<p>All remote write operations issued to a particular remote processing element (PE) prior to the call to shmem_fence are guaranteed to be delivered before any subsequent remote write operations to the same PE which follows the call to shmem_fence.</p>
<p>The shmem_quiet function should be called if ordering of remote writes is desired when multiple remote PEs are involved.
</p>

<h4>IBM NOTES</h4>
<div class="ledi">
<dl>
<p>IBM's current implementation of this function is the same as shmem_quiet.  The ability of per destination fence will be added later</p>
