<h4>Purpose</h4>


<p>Performs an atomic conditional swap to a symmetric data object.
</p>

<h4>C syntax</h4>

<pre>
#include &lt;shmem.h&gt;
 
short shmem_short_cswap(short *target, short cond, short value, int pe);
 
</pre>

<h4>Parameters</h4>


<dl>
<dt class="bold">INPUT</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt class="bold ">target</dt>
<dd>The remotely accessible integer data object to be updated on the PE.
</dd>
<dt class="bold ">cond</dt>
<dd>cond is compared to the target value.  If cond and the target are equal, then value is swapped into the target.  Otherwise, the target is unchanged.  In either case, the old value of the target is returned as the function return value.  cond must be of the same data type as target.
</dd>
<dt class="bold ">value</dt>
<dd>Value to be atomically written to the target PE.  Value is the same type as target.
<dt class="bold ">pe</dt>
<dd>An integer indicating the PE number on which target is to be
updated.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Description</h4>

<div class="ledi">
<p>This conditional swap routine conditionally update a target data object on an
arbitrary processing element (PE) and return prior contents of the data object in one
atomic operation. </p>
<p>The function shmem_short_cswap performs an atomic conditional operation on a
remotely accessible short data object.</p>
<p>The atomic accessing of the shared variable is guaranteed only when that variable is updated solely using IBM openshmem functions.</p>

<h4>Return values</h4>
<p>This function returns the contents that had been at the target address on the remote
PE prior to the swap is returned.</p>


<h4>IBM NOTES</h4>
<div class="ledi">
<dl>
<p>To utilize the hardware atomic operations support of the PERCS system, the variables of these operations should be aligned with their natural byte alignments.  For example, an int variable should be 4-byte aligned; a long long variable should be 8-byte aligned.  If the participating variables are not aligned, the operation is done in software with sub-optimal performance</p>
